# Service Button URL Guide for Admins

This guide explains how to add and edit URL buttons for service items in LankyStocks.

## How to Edit Service Items and Add URL Buttons

1. **Access the Frontend Manager**:
   - Log in to your admin panel
   - Click on "Frontend Manager" in the sidebar
   
2. **Find the Service Section**:
   - In the Frontend Manager, locate the card labeled "Service Section"
   - Click on the gear/cog icon (⚙️) on that card
   
3. **View Service Elements**:
   - You'll see a list of all service items you've created
   - Each service item has an "Edit" button (pencil icon)
   
4. **Edit a Service Item**:
   - Click the "Edit" button on the service item you want to modify
   - This opens the edit form with all fields for that service item
   
5. **Add or Update the URL**:
   - Find the "URL" field in the form
   - Enter the full URL for where the button should link to (e.g., `https://lankystocks.com/tiktok-service`)
   - For internal links, you can use relative URLs (e.g., `/services/tiktok`)
   
6. **Save Changes**:
   - Click the "Submit" button at the bottom of the form to save your changes
   
7. **Add New Service Items**:
   - To add a new service item, click the "Add New" button at the top of the service section page
   - Fill in all required fields, including the URL field
   - Click "Submit" to create the new service item with a button

## Important Notes:

- If the URL field is left empty, the button will use the default route (service details page)
- Always include the full URL with `http://` or `https://` for external links
- For consistent appearance, ensure all service items either all have URLs or none have URLs

## Testing:

After adding or editing URLs, visit your website's homepage to test the buttons and ensure they redirect to the correct pages.
